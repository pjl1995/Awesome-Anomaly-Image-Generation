# Anomaly Image Generation
In industrial scenarios, anomaly data is extremely scarce due to high acquisition costs. The scarcity of anomaly data limits the performance of anomaly detection algorithms. Therefore, anomaly image generation methods can be used to obtain more anomaly data and improve the performance of anomaly detection algorithms. anomaly image generation is a challenging task as it not only needs to generate a large number of diverse anomaly images with limited training data but also needs to generate corresponding pixel-level labels.
